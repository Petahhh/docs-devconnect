## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

**The overview describes the service that your product offers to Pivotal Platform developers.
Make sure to overview the features of the integration.
Don't focus only on the overview of your product that is being integrated.
See below for an example.**

```
The Apigee Edge Service Broker for Pivotal Platform registers a service broker with Pivotal Platform and exposes its service plans on the
Marketplace. Developers can then create service plan instances using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command
Line Interface (cf CLI) and bind them to their apps.

Creating an Apigee Edge for Pivotal Platform service instance and binding it to an app creates an Apigee Edge API proxy that
handles requests for the app. This lets developers use the Apigee Edge management console to manage API request
handling between clients and the app.
```

<!-- **Note**: This overview should appear under **OVERVIEW**, combined with the prior description above in the tile's listing on

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

**List any known limitations.**

## <a id="terms"></a><%= vars.product_short %> Terminology

<%= vars.product_short %> uses the following terms:

+ **Foundation:** This is an installation of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.
    A single foundation is located in a single region.
    Configuring multiple foundations enables high availability across different regions.
    <br><br>
    You can configure foundations for different levels of production.
    For example, you might configure a foundation for a sandbox, development, staging, or production level.
    The levels of production correspond to environments.

+ **Project:** This is a collection of environments across one or more foundations.
    This organizational structure enables you to view all the regions where you can deploy your apps.<br><br>
    For example, you may have an app in:

    * Two production environments, one in `us-west` and another in `us-east` for high availability
    * One staging environment in `us-west`
    * One development environment in `us-west`

+ **Environment:** This is where developers can deploy apps.
    Operators can define labels for environment, such as `production` or `development`,
    and assign permissions to the environment.

+ **Dashboard:** The <%= vars.product_short %> dashboard displays the projects and the corresponding environments
    operators have created.
