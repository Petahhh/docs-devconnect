#<a id='using'></a> Glossary

<%= vars.product_full %> helps get setup quickly to deploy applications across the different foundations.
Here are some key terms:

##<a name='term-foundation'></a> Foundation
A Foundation is an installation of <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>).

A single foundation is located in a single region.
Having multiple foundations allows for high availability across different regions (e.g. West and East).
A foundation may also be configured to a specific production level (e.g. sandbox, development, staging, and production).
These production levels correspond to Environments.


## Project
<%= vars.product_full %> allows you to create projects, which are a collection of environments across one or more foundations.
This organizational structure allows you to view all the places where you can deploy your apps. For example, you may have an app in:
* two production environments, one in us-west and another in us-east for high availability
* one staging environment in us-west, and
* one development environment in us-west

## Environment
An environment is a labeled place you can deploy your app. Administrators can define environment labels such as "production" or "development" and assign permissions to the environment. For example a "production" environment can be configured so that developers can only have the auditor role.

## Dashboard
The Dashboard displays the projects and the corresponding environments that have been created.
