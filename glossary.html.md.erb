This topic describes terms used in <%= vars.product_full %>.

<%= vars.product_short %> helps developers to quickly deploy apps across different foundations.

##<a id='foundation'></a> Foundation
A Foundation is a installation of <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>).

A single foundation is located in a single region.
Having multiple foundations enables high availability across different regions.

You might configure a foundation for a specific production level.
For example, sandbox, development, staging, or production.
Production levels correspond to environments.


##<a id='project'></a> Project
Projects are a collection of environments across one or more foundations.
This organizational structure enables you to view all the regions where you can deploy your apps.
For example, you may have an app in:

* Two production environments, one in us-west and another in us-east for high availability
* One staging environment in us-west
* One development environment in us-west

##<a id='environment'></a> Environment
An environment is a labeled place you can deploy your app.
Admins can define environment labels such as `production` or `development`
and assign permissions to the environment.

##<a id='dashboard'></a> Dashboard
The <%= vars.product_short %> dashboard displays the projects and the corresponding environments
that have been created.
